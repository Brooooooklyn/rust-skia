This is a supporting package for [skia-safe](https://crates.io/crates/skia-safe), which provides safe Rust bindings to the [Skia Graphics Library](https://skia.org/).

## Organization

This package contains three components. 

- Full configuration and build support for Skia in [`build.rs`](build.rs) and  [`build_support/`](build_support/).
- Additional C binding sources used to complete the bindgen generated bindings and to work around linker errors.
- A number of functions that are used to download prebuilt binaries.

### Skia Build Support

Building Skia is quite complicated, a number of prerequisites need to be met and configured properly for the target platform.

To configure and build Skia, [`build_support/skia.rs`](build_support/skia.rs) does all the hard work: it pulls `depot_tools/` and `skia/` from Google's repositories and a number of additional dependencies by executing `skia/tools/git-sync-deps` with Python. After that, it configures Skia with Google's [GN](https://gn.googlesource.com/gn/+/refs/heads/master/README.md) tool, and finally builds the libraries by giving up control to the `ninja` executable from the `depot_tools/` package.

### Binding Generation

The `src/*.cpp` files and `src/bindings.rs`  contain the code that Rust needs to bind to Skia's codebase. The C++ binding source files are directly compiled together with Skia's build and the bindings are generated by the [Rust's binding generator](<https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen>) utilizing libclang through [clang-sys](https://crates.io/crates/clang-sys).

If these steps went well, the resulting Rust binding code is written to `src/bindings.rs`.

### Debug Builds

By default, and for performance reasons, Skia is built in release mode even when cargo creates debug output. Skia debug builds can be enabled only by explicitly setting the environment variable `SKIA_DEBUG=1`.

### Prebuilt Binaries

Because building Skia _and_ creating the bindings is slow and depend on a number of components that are foreign to the Rust ecosystem, we decided to release prebuilt binaries.

Whenever a new version of `rust-skia` is built from the `release` branch on our CI server, the resulting Skia library _and_ `bindings.rs` are uploaded to the [skia-binaries repository](<https://github.com/rust-skia/skia-binaries/releases>) as release artifacts.

And whenever the build script detects that `skia-bindings` is built from inside a crate _and_ a prebuilt archive is available that matches the repository's hash, platform, and features, it downloads the package, unpacks it, and skips the full build step of Skia and the bindings generation.

## Offline Builds

A full build of Skia downloads several repositories from the Internet. For specific scenarios, like, for example, [a packaging script](https://github.com/rust-skia/rust-skia/issues/340), it can be useful to build Skia offline. To configure that, the build script supports the following environment variables:

| Variable                     | Description                                                  | Default                            |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `SKIA_OFFLINE_SOURCE_DIR`    | An absolute path pointing to a complete Skia source tree including all dependencies. Setting this variable activates the offline build mode. |                                    |
| `SKIA_OFFLINE_NINJA_COMMAND` | The ninja command to run. This can be either a filename, or a absolute path to the ninja executable. | `ninja` or `ninja.exe`  on Windows |
| `SKIA_OFFLINE_GN_COMMAND`    | The `gn` command to run. Either an absolute path or a path relative to Skia's source directory. | `bin/gn`                           |

## Build Customization

Besides of the features that can be directly specified when the package is added as a cargo dependency, the Skia build can be customized further in `build.rs` by adjusting one of two structs that are defined in `build_support/skia.rs`:

### `BuildConfiguration`

This struct represents the top level build configuration for `skia-bindings` and contains a number of individual feature flags.

### `FinalBuildConfiguration`

The `FinalBuildConfiguration` is created from the `BuildConfiguration` and contains name value pairs used by GN to parameterize the Skia build and preprocessor defines used to create the `src/bindings.rs`.
